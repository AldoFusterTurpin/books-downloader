# books-downloader
Python program that allows you to download with ease books from the Spring webpage.

Hi ðŸ˜ƒ,
"Spring" publisher allows you to download > 500 books in PDF format from its official web page.

This is the Webpage:

https://link.springer.com/search/page/2?showAll=true&package=mat-covid19_textbooks&facet-content-type=%22Book%22&sortOrder=newestFirst

You can download files using thwo different approaches:

Mehtod 1 -> Manual download

Mehtod 2 -> Semmi-automatic download (Recommended jeje)


METHOD 1

If you want to download some books, you go to their webpage and click on every book you are interested in and follow a manual download approach.
This involves the following steps:
1) go to 

https://link.springer.com/search/page/2?showAll=true&package=mat-covid19_textbooks&facet-content-type=%22Book%22&sortOrder=newestFirst
    TODO add photo

2) For every book you are interested in, do the following (example with a random book):
    
    2.1) Click in the link of the book (in my example click in "Quick Start Guide to VHDL")
        TODO add photo
    
    2.2) The Book details page will appear
        TODO add photo
    
    2.3) Click the "Download book PDF"
        TODO add photo

    2.4) New tab with the Book in pdf will appear. Now you can download the file.
        TODO add photo


If your are downloading few books, this is not much effort but if you are found of technical books and want to download many books, you will find yourself a little bit frustrated after the tenth (random number xD) download.

That's why I created this Python program that allows you to download the books saving you a lot of time. The set up process is easier than it seems.
What you have to do is follow the Mehtod 2:

METHOD 2

You can follow the instructions below. I also created this video to help you. I encorauge you to watch the video.
TODO add link to youtube video.

2.1) Download this github folder.

2.2) Go to https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
    and download the driver depending on your Google Chrome Version (to know your version, open Google Chrome and go to Chrome -> About Google Chrome or similar).
    Save the corresponding zip into this folder. Extract the file and rename the extracted file to "chromedriver" (if it has a different name). Now you can delete the .zip file

2.3) Open a Terminal and navigate to this folder
    
2.4) Create a new virtual environment and install dependencies

    python3 -m venv env

    source env/bin/activate

    pip install requirements.txt 


2.3) Go to the Spring page:
    https://link.springer.com/search/page/2?showAll=true&package=mat-covid19_textbooks&facet-content-type=%22Book%22&sortOrder=newestFirst
    TODO add photo

2.4) For every book that you find interesting, right click on the book name and select "Copy link address"
    TODO add photo

2.5) Open the file "input.txt" (or create it in this folder with the exact same name if it doesn't exist) and paste the copied link in a new line
    TODO add photo

2.6) Repeat steps 2.4 and 2.5 for all the books you want to Download (remember to Paste each new link in a new line of the "input.txt" file).
    Save the "input.txt" file

2.7) Go to the terminal (you will need to be in this folder) and execute

    python3 download_Spring_books.py

2.8)    Enjoy your books ðŸ‘“

Cheers!
